RE: Response to Notice to Quit for Non-Payment of Rent
    Property Address: [propertyAddress]
    Notice Date: [noticeDate]

Dear [landlordName],

I am writing in response to the Notice to Quit for Non-Payment of Rent dated [noticeDate] that I received regarding the above-referenced property.

PAYMENT DISPUTE AND LEGAL DEFENSES

I hereby dispute this eviction notice on the following grounds under New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (RPAPL) and Real Property Law:

1. **IMPROPER NOTICE DEFECTS**
   The notice you served contains legal defects that make it invalid under RPAPL Section 711:
   - [Check if applicable: The notice period is incorrect - must be 14 days for month-to-month tenancy]
   - [Check if applicable: The amount demanded is incorrect or includes illegal charges]
   - [Check if applicable: The notice was not properly served according to RPAPL Section 735]

2. **RENT PAYMENT RECORDS**
   My rent payment history shows:
   - Last rent payment: $[lastPaymentAmount] on [lastPaymentDate]
   - Payment method: [paymentMethod]
   - Current rent amount: $[monthlyRent] per month

3. **RENT STABILIZATION DEFENSES**
   [If applicable] This property is subject to rent stabilization laws, and:
   - The rent increase may be improper under Rent Stabilization Code
   - I have not received proper renewal lease documentation
   - The rent amount exceeds legal guidelines

4. **WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY**
   The property has the following habitability issues that affect my obligation to pay rent under Real Property Law Section 235-b:
   - [List any habitability issues if applicable]
   - Multiple violations of Housing Maintenance Code
   - Lack of essential services (heat, hot water, etc.)

5. **RETALIATORY EVICTION PROTECTION**
   [If applicable] This eviction appears to be in retaliation for [specific tenant action], which is prohibited under Real Property Law Section 223-b.

6. **EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE**
   [If applicable] I have applied for Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) and am protected under current state legislation.

DEMAND FOR CURE AND COMPLIANCE

If there are legitimate amounts owed, I am willing to discuss a reasonable payment plan. However, I maintain that this eviction notice is legally defective and demand that you:

1. Withdraw this improper notice immediately
2. Provide proper accounting of any amounts claimed to be owed including breakdown of rent, fees, and charges
3. Allow reasonable time for payment arrangements if legitimate amounts are due
4. Provide required disclosures under NYC rent stabilization laws (if applicable)

NOTICE OF INTENT TO DEFEND

Please be advised that if you proceed with this holdover or non-payment proceeding, I intend to vigorously defend my rights in Housing Court. New York law provides strong tenant protections, and improper eviction attempts can result in significant damages to landlords under RPAPL Section 853.

I request that you contact me immediately to resolve this matter without the need for litigation.

Sincerely,

[tenantName]
