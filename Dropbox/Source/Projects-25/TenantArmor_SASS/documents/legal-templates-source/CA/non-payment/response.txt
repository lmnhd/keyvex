Dear [landlordName],

I am writing in response to the Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit dated [noticeDate] that I received regarding the above-referenced property.

PAYMENT DISPUTE AND LEGAL DEFENSES

I hereby dispute this eviction notice on the following grounds under California Civil Code and the Tenant Protection Act:

1. **IMPROPER NOTICE DEFECTS**
   The notice you served contains legal defects that make it invalid under California Civil Code Section 1161:
   - [Check if applicable: The notice period is incorrect]
   - [Check if applicable: The amount demanded is incorrect]
   - [Check if applicable: The notice was not properly served according to CCP Section 1162]

2. **RENT PAYMENT RECORDS**
   My rent payment history shows:
   - Last rent payment: $[lastPaymentAmount] on [lastPaymentDate]
   - Payment method: [paymentMethod]
   - Current rent amount: $[monthlyRent] per month

4. **RETALIATORY EVICTION PROTECTION**
   [If applicable] This eviction appears to be in retaliation for [specific tenant action], which is prohibited under Civil Code Section 1942.5.

5. **COVID-19 RENTAL ASSISTANCE**
   [If applicable] I have applied for COVID-19 rental assistance and am protected under SB 91 and AB 832.

DEMAND FOR CURE AND COMPLIANCE

If there are legitimate amounts owed, I am willing to discuss a reasonable payment plan. However, I maintain that this eviction notice is legally defective and demand that you:

1. Withdraw this improper notice immediately
2. Provide proper accounting of any amounts claimed to be owed
3. Allow reasonable time for payment arrangements if legitimate amounts are due

NOTICE OF INTENT TO DEFEND

Please be advised that if you proceed with this unlawful detainer action, I intend to vigorously defend my rights in court. California law provides strong tenant protections, and improper eviction attempts can result in significant damages to landlords.

I request that you contact me immediately to resolve this matter without the need for litigation.

Sincerely,
