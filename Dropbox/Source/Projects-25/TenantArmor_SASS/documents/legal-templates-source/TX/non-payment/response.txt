RE: Response to Notice to Quit
    Property Address: [propertyAddress]
    Notice Date: [noticeDate]

Dear [landlordName],

I am writing in response to the Notice to Quit dated [noticeDate] that I received regarding the above-referenced property.

PAYMENT DISPUTE AND LEGAL DEFENSES

I hereby dispute this eviction notice on the following grounds under Texas Property Code and applicable tenant protection laws:

1. **IMPROPER NOTICE DEFECTS**
   The notice you served contains legal defects that make it invalid under Texas Property Code Section 24.005:
   - [Check if applicable: The notice period is incorrect - must be at least 3 days]
   - [Check if applicable: The amount demanded is incorrect or includes illegal fees]
   - [Check if applicable: The notice was not properly served according to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure]
   - [Check if applicable: Notice fails to comply with lease terms regarding notice procedures]

2. **RENT PAYMENT RECORDS**
   My rent payment history shows:
   - Last rent payment: $[lastPaymentAmount] on [lastPaymentDate]
   - Payment method: [paymentMethod]
   - Current rent amount: $[monthlyRent] per month

3. **CONDITION OF PREMISES**
   The property has the following habitability issues that affect my obligation to pay rent under Texas Property Code Section 92.056:
   - [List any habitability issues if applicable]
   - Lack of essential utilities or services
   - Health and safety violations
   - Failure to make requested repairs affecting habitability

4. **RETALIATORY EVICTION PROTECTION**
   [If applicable] This eviction appears to be in retaliation for [specific tenant action], which is prohibited under Texas Property Code Section 92.331.

5. **IMPROPER FEES AND CHARGES**
   The amount demanded includes:
   - [If applicable] Late fees that exceed lease terms or are unreasonable under Texas law
   - [If applicable] Utilities or charges not properly allocated under lease agreement
   - [If applicable] Other charges that are not properly documented or legal

6. **RENTAL ASSISTANCE**
   [If applicable] I have applied for emergency rental assistance and am seeking resolution through available assistance programs.

DEMAND FOR CURE AND COMPLIANCE

If there are legitimate amounts owed, I am willing to discuss a reasonable payment plan. However, I maintain that this eviction notice is legally defective and demand that you:

1. Withdraw this improper notice immediately
2. Provide proper accounting of any amounts claimed to be owed with documentation
3. Allow reasonable time for payment arrangements if legitimate amounts are due
4. Provide receipts for all claimed charges and fees

NOTICE OF INTENT TO DEFEND

Please be advised that if you proceed with this forcible detainer action, I intend to vigorously defend my rights in Justice Court. Texas law provides tenant protections, and improper eviction attempts can result in damages to landlords.

Texas Property Code Section 92.0081 requires specific procedures for eviction, and failure to follow proper notice and procedures can invalidate the eviction process.

I request that you contact me immediately to resolve this matter without the need for litigation.

Sincerely,

[tenantName]
