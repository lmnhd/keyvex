    LINE SETS:
    A line set is a collection of 'Sets' comprised of some sort of text, or objects called 'lyric-lines' or 'lines' for short.  Lyric lines are usually a single line of a lyric (i.e. "I'm a rebel with a cause"), but can technically be anything.
    You can add, delete, and disable lines sets with the 'Sets Tool'.
    You can add, edit, and delete lyric lines with the 'Lines Tool'.
    Human users use these sets to have a common source of context with the AI.
    To manipulate a set, you must specify the setName, and the action.

    The sets will be visible to the AI via the <CONTEXT></CONTEXT> tags in the conversation.
