    🔍 PATTERN RECOGNITION: Different tool types require different data structures:

    📊 COMPARISON/RANKING TOOLS:
    Examples: Neighborhood ranking, college comparison, investment options
    ❌ Problem: Gets single averages → "Average home price: $350k"
    ✅ Solution: Need comparative datasets → Multiple neighborhoods with varying prices, schools, commute times
    Data Structure: Arrays of options with multiple attributes for ranking
    
    🧮 CALCULATOR TOOLS:
    Examples: Mortgage calculator, solar ROI, tax calculator
    ✅ Works Well: Current rates, terms → "30-year mortgage at 6.75%"
    ❌ Might Miss: Regional variations → State tax rates, local incentives, utility rates
    Data Structure: Current rates, rules, and regional variations
    
    📈 ASSESSMENT/SCORING TOOLS:
    Examples: Credit score assessment, home readiness quiz, risk tolerance
    ❌ Problem: Gets averages → "Average credit score: 680"

1. **IDENTIFY TOOL TYPE**: Based on the concept and calculations, determine if this is:
   - COMPARISON/RANKING: Compares multiple options (neighborhoods, colleges, investments)
   - CALCULATOR: Performs calculations with current rates/data (mortgage, solar, tax)
   - ASSESSMENT/SCORING: Evaluates user based on criteria (credit, readiness, risk)
   - DECISION SUPPORT: Helps choose between options (insurance, career, retirement)
   - PLANNING/OPTIMIZATION: Allocates resources optimally (budget, schedule, workout)

2. **GENERATE APPROPRIATE DATA STRUCTURE**: 
   - For COMPARISON tools: Create arrays of options with multiple attributes
   - For ASSESSMENT tools: Create scoring criteria and factor weights  
   - For CALCULATOR tools: Provide current rates and regional variations
   - For DECISION tools: Create option matrices with trade-offs
   - For PLANNING tools: Create allocation rules and optimization parameters

3. **AVOID GENERIC TEMPLATES**: Don't use "average value + standard deviation" for all domains

4. **CHECK EXTERNAL DATA NEEDS**: If any calculation references external data (tax rates, market prices, industry standards), set hasExternalDataNeeds=true

USER INSTRUCTIONS GUIDANCE:
The userInstructions field should provide guidance to the APP USER (the person creating this tool) about what external data structure they need to provide. Focus on the specific data structure pattern that matches the tool type.

Examples:
- COMPARISON: "You need to provide a dataset of [items] with [attributes] for comparison"
- ASSESSMENT: "You need to provide scoring criteria and factor weights for evaluation"
- CALCULATOR: "You need to provide current [rates/standards] for accurate calculations"
- DECISION: "You need to provide option comparison data with costs, benefits, and trade-offs"
