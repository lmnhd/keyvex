    Before generating ANY tool concept, you must honestly assess:
    
    1. PROBLEM CLARITY: Is there a specific, well-defined problem that ${targetAudience} faces?
    2. CALCULATION VIABILITY: Can meaningful calculations be performed with reasonable inputs?
    3. BUSINESS VALUE: Will this tool provide actionable insights worth the user's time?
    4. IMPLEMENTATION REALITY: Can all suggested features be implemented with real business logic?
    
    If any answer is "NO" or "UNCLEAR", recommend a more focused approach rather than generating a contrived tool.
