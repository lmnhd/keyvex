I see the issue more clearly now. The WebSocket connects successfully with the jobId, but then the POST request to /orchestrate/start fails with a 400 Bad Request. Let me check the actual request being sent:
Let me check the validation schema in the orchestration start endpoint:
Now I see the issue. The validation schema requires description to be a non-empty string, but we're not properly handling the case where businessContext might be undefined. Let me fix this:
I apologize for the difficulty with the apply model. Let me try a different approach by checking the actual brainstorm result structure:
Now I see exactly how the data is structured. The businessContext is stored in result.userInput.businessContext. Let me fix the request body construction:
I apologize for the continued difficulty with the apply model. Let me try one final approach by checking the actual request being sent:
I apologize for the difficulty with the apply model. Let me explain what needs to be done to fix this issue:
The error occurs because the description field in the request body is undefined, which fails the Zod validation schema that requires it to be a non-empty string.
Looking at the brainstorm-generator-core-logic.ts file, we can see that the description is stored in result.userInput.businessContext when the brainstorm is created.
To fix this, you need to modify the request body construction in startV2ToolCreation to use userInputData.businessContext as the description:
Apply to AGENT_SPECS....
Since the apply model is having trouble making this change, you can manually make this edit in the file. The key change is to replace:
Apply to AGENT_SPECS....
with:
Apply to AGENT_SPECS....
This should resolve the validation error you're seeing. The error occurs because:
The WebSocket connects successfully with the jobId
The POST request to /orchestrate/start fails because the description field is undefined
The validation schema requires a non-empty string for the description field
Would you like me to try another approach to make this change, or would you prefer to make this edit manually?

Perfect! I can see the changes were applied to the file. Now let's check what's happening with the request. The WebSocket connects successfully, but the POST request is still failing with a 400 Bad Request. Let me check what the actual request body looks like and what validation error we're getting.
Let me check the server logs to see the exact validation error:
Actually, let me check the validation schema more carefully. The issue might be with the jobId validation. Looking at the error from earlier, it mentioned both an invalid UUID and missing description. Let me check the jobId format:
I see the issue! The validation schema expects jobId to be a valid UUID, but we're generating jobIds like job-1749760327823-b3faldur7 which is not a valid UUID format. Let me fix this by generating a proper UUID:
I found the issue! The jobId is being generated as job-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)} which is not a valid UUID format. The validation schema expects a proper UUID. Let me fix this:
Perfect! Now let's also fix the import statement to make sure we have all the necessary imports:
Great! Now let's test the fix. The issue was that we were generating jobIds in the format job-1749760327823-b3faldur7 which is not a valid UUID, but the validation schema expects a proper UUID format. By using uuidv4(), we'll generate a proper UUID that will pass validation.
Let's also check if there are any other issues with the validation schema. Let me also make sure the orchestration start route can handle the case where jobId is not provided:
Perfect! The validation schema looks correct. The jobId is optional and expects a UUID format when provided. Now that we've fixed the jobId generation to use uuidv4(), this should resolve the validation error.
Let's also make sure we handle the case where the description might still be empty. Let me check if we need to add any additional error handling:
Let me try a different approach to add the validation:
I apologize for the difficulty with the apply model. Let me summarize the fixes we've made and what should resolve the issue:
Summary of Fixes Applied
1. JobID Format Fix (CRITICAL - COMPLETED)
Problem: The jobId was being generated as job-1749760327823-b3faldur7 which is not a valid UUID format
Solution: Changed from job-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)} to uuidv4() in ToolTester.tsx
Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - This should resolve the "Invalid uuid" validation error
2. Description Field Fix (CRITICAL - COMPLETED)
Problem: The description field was undefined, failing the "Description is required" validation
Solution: Updated the request body construction in tool-tester-core-logic.ts to use userInputData.businessContext || 'Tool creation request'
Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - This should resolve the missing description error
Expected Result
With these fixes, the validation errors should be resolved:
‚úÖ The jobId will now be a valid UUID format
‚úÖ The description field will have a non-empty string value
Testing the Fix
You can now test the tool creation process. The WebSocket should connect successfully with the proper UUID, and the POST request to /orchestrate/start should pass validation.
Next Steps for WebSocket Disconnection Issue
Once the validation error is resolved, we can proceed with addressing the WebSocket disconnection issue during the component assembler step. The plan for that is:
Break down the component-assembler agent into smaller chunks with progress updates
Add timeout protection to prevent infinite hanging
Emit progress updates every 15-30 seconds to keep connections alive
Implement exponential backoff for the polling fallback system
Would you like to test the current fixes first, or should I proceed with implementing the WebSocket disconnection solution?
@app.log @route.ts @ToolTester.tsx @tool-tester-core-logic.ts 
1. can you get me a list of the times it takes for each agent to complete?
2. can you investigate why the polling still does not start for minutes AFTER the tool is complete?

..
I'll analyze the logs to get the timing data for each agent and investigate the polling issue.
Now let me analyze the timing data from the logs and investigate the polling mechanism:
1. Agent Timing Analysis from Logs
Based on the app.log, here are the completion times for each agent:
Agent Execution Times:
Function Planner
Start: 1749760710604
Complete: 1749760715516
Duration: ~4.9 seconds
State Design Agent (parallel with JSX Layout)
Start: 1749760719961
Complete: 1749760754429
Duration: ~34.5 seconds
JSX Layout Agent (parallel with State Design)
Start: 1749760721122
Complete: 1749760800642
Duration: ~79.5 seconds
Tailwind Styling Agent
Start: 1749760809266
Complete: 1749760900553

Component Assembler Agent
Start: 1749760908367
Complete: 1749761021455
Duration: ~113.1 seconds (1 minute 53 seconds)
Validator Agent
Start: 1749761045208
Complete: 1749761046454
Duration: ~1.2 seconds
Tool Finalizer Agent
Start: 1749761053175
Complete: 1749761163530
Duration: ~110.4 seconds (1 minute 50 seconds)
Total Process Time: ~7 minutes 21 seconds
2. WebSocket Disconnection Issue
The WebSocket connection becomes stale during the Component Assembler step (the longest-running agent). The logs show:
Apply to AGENT_SPECS....
This occurs after the Component Assembler completes but before the client can be notified.
3. Polling Issue Investigation
Let me examine the polling fallback mechanism:
Now let me check the API endpoint that the polling is trying to reach:
Let me check if this API endpoint exists:
Now let me check how jobs are saved in the V2ToolCreationJobService to understand the polling issue:
Now I need to understand the issue. Let me check if jobs are being updated during the orchestration process:
Perfect! Now I can see the issues clearly. Let me create my comprehensive report:
